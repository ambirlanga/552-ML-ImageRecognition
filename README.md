# Ariel Martinez Birlanga - Image Recognition

Developed a machine learning model to classify environment images (urban, forest, desert, etc.) from extracted numerical features. Built an XGBoost-based pipeline for feature extraction, training, and performance evaluation.

Make sure the 'notebook' and 'data' folders are located in the same repository while execting the Jupyter Notebook; this is needed for the notebook to access the dataset.

The notebook was originaly executed on Kaggle, but for easier replication the path for training and test (train_dir and test_dir paths) has been rewriten for local use (First 2 lines of the first section, without counting imports).
